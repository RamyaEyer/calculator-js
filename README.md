Calculator with GUI in Javascript

Simple 4 function calculator themed after Beemo from Adventure Time...I mean a talking apocalypse video game console. 

Future updates include keyboard support, the face of character as default display, error-checking for double-clicking functions, and responsive design. However, I need to move onto other projects for the time being.
